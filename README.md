# ChoiceAdaptationModels_NHB

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts used in the study "Human Decision Making beyond Prospect Theory" submitted to Nature Human Behavior.  
The scripts process and fit data to models IMA, DIST, OPT, and RL. Both data and scripts are organized per experiment.

## Repository Structure
Folder 'Exp1' contains file 'data_dom2val.mat' containing data of all participants in Experiment 1 and a subfolder 'domval' containing scripts to fit models to choices of any one participant. The data of individual participants have the following IDs: 132	135	159	174	178	131	136	163	166	177	142	144	156	161	171	145	148	152	154	137	138	149	175	140	150	151	153	162	147	155	158	160	167	170	143	157	165	169

Folder 'Exp2' contains file 'data_gain.mat' containing data of all participants in Experiment 2 and a subfolder 'gainpar' containing scripts to fit models to choices of any one participant. The data of individual participants have the following IDs: 25,27,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,42,43,45,46,47,48,49,50,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,61,62

Folder 'Exp3' contains file 'data_loss.mat' containing data of all participants in Experiment 3 and a subfolder 'losspar' containing scripts to fit models to choices of any one participant. The data of individual participants have the following IDs: 69,70,71,72,73,75,76,77,78,79,80,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,99,100,101
