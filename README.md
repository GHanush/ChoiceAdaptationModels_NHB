# ChoiceAdaptationModels_NHB

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts used in the study "Human Decision Making beyond Prospect Theory" submitted to Nature Human Behavior.  
The scripts process and fit data to models IMA, DIST, OPT, and RL. Both data and scripts are organized per experiment.

## Repository Structure
Folder 'Exp1' contains file 'data_dom2val.mat' containing data of all participants in Experiment 1 and a subfolder 'domval' containing scripts to fit models to choices of any one participant.

Folder 'Exp2' contains file 'data_gain.mat' containing data of all participants in Experiment 2 and a subfolder 'gainpar' containing scripts to fit models to choices of any one participant.

Folder 'Exp3' contains file 'data_loss.mat' containing data of all participants in Experiment 3 and a subfolder 'losspar' containing scripts to fit models to choices of any one participant. 

## Instructions to use
1. Download folder 'ChoiceAdaptationModels_NHB'.  
2. Open MATLAB.  
3. Navigate to subfolder 'Exp1', 'Exp2', or 'Exp3' to run model fitting to data of Experiment 1,2, or 3, respectively.
4. Follow instructions in file 'README.md' in chosen subfolder 'Exp1', 'Exp2', or 'Exp3'.

## Notes
This repository is intended for reviewers.
All scripts are compatible with MATLAB 2021a and later versions.
No additional licenses or toolboxes are required beyond standard MATLAB functions.
No non-standard hardware is required.
